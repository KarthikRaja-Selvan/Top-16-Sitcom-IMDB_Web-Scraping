# IMDB Top 16 Sitcom Shows Web Scraped Datasets
IMDb (Internet Movie Database) is an online database of information related to movies or tv shows like plot description, Metascore ratings, critic and user ratings and reviews, and release dates (sometimes even trivia facts!). Most of the data in the database is provided by volunteer contributors. In this repository, I have showcased my web scraping ability by scraping IMDB website.

These above datasets contains information regarding IMDB top 16 sitcom shows of all time. The data in these dataset has been scrapped using BeautifulSoup and Requests library from the publicly available website https://www.imdb.com.

Iâ€™ve also attached my python script in the .ipynb format (Jupyter Notebook). I admit that there is still room for improvement. So, please feel free to use the datasets and contribute your ideas in this repository.
